	abstract = {Plants and insects use slender conical structures to transport and collect small droplets, which are propelled along the conical structures due to capillary action. These droplets can deposit a fluid film during their motion, but despite its importance to many biological systems and industrial applications, the properties of the deposited film are unknown. We characterize the film deposition by developing an asymptotic analysis together with experimental measurements and numerical simulations based on the lubrication equation. We show that the deposited film thickness depends significantly on both the fiber radius and the droplet size, highlighting that the coating is affected by finite-size effects relevant to film deposition on fibers of any slender geometry. We demonstrate that by changing the droplet size, while the mean fiber radius and the capillary number are fixed, the thickness of the deposited film can change by an order of magnitude or more. We show that self-propelled droplets have significant potential to create passively coated structures.},

	abstract = {Biology is suffused with rhythmic behaviour, and interacting biological oscillators often synchronize their rhythms with one another. Colonies of some ant species are able to synchronize their activity to fall into coherent bursts, but models of this phenomenon have neglected the potential effects of intrinsic noise and interspecific differences in individual-level behaviour. We investigated the individual and collective activity patterns of two
              Leptothorax
              ant species. We show that in one species (
              Leptothorax
              sp. W), ants converge onto rhythmic cycles of synchronized collective activity with a period of about 20 min. A second species (
              Leptothorax crassipilis
              ) exhibits more complex collective dynamics, where dominant collective cycle periods range from 16 min to 2.8 h. Recordings that last 35 h reveal that, in both species, the same colony can exhibit multiple oscillation frequencies. We observe that workers of both species can be stimulated by nest-mates to become active after a refractory resting period, but the durations of refractory periods differ between the species and can be highly variable. We model the emergence of synchronized rhythms using an agent-based model informed by our empirical data. This simple model successfully generates synchronized group oscillations despite the addition of noise to ants' refractory periods. We also find that adding noise reduces the likelihood that the model will spontaneously switch between distinct collective cycle frequencies.},

	abstract = {Synchronization is a conspicuous form of collective behaviour that is of crucial importance in numerous biological systems. Ant colonies from the genera
              Leptothorax
              and
              Temnothorax
              form small colonies, typically made up of only a few hundred workers, and exhibit a form of synchronized behaviour where workers inside colonies' nests become active together in rhythmic cycles that have a period of approximately 20–200 min. However, it is not currently known if these synchronized rhythms of locomotion confer any functional benefit to colonies. By using a combination of multiple image analysis techniques, we show that inactive
              Leptothorax
              ants can act as immobile obstacles to moving ants, and that synchronized activity has the potential to reduce the likelihood that individual ants will encounter regions of immobile obstacles that impede access to portions of the nest. We demonstrate qualitatively similar findings using a computational model of confined active particles with oscillating activity.},

	abstract = {A slender object undergoing an axial compression will buckle to alleviate the stress. Typically the morphology of the deformed object depends on the bending stiffness for solids, or the viscoelastic properties for liquid threads. We study a chain of uniform sticky air bubbles that rise due to buoyancy through an aqueous bath. A buckling instability of the bubble chain with a characteristic wavelength is observed. If a chain of bubbles is produced faster than it is able to rise, the dominance of viscous drag over buoyancy results in a compressive stress that is alleviated by buckling the bubble chain. Using low Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we predict the critical buckling speed, the terminal speed of a buckled chain, and the geometry of the buckles.},
