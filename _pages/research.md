In my research in soft matter physics, I study why some soft matter systems deform and why others don't.  Often, this takes place over different systems, and my specialties range from capillary driven flow of droplets and films to stability in granular material.


Feel free to check my [publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) and [presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}/talks) and if you have questions, don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:{{site.email}}).
