Carmen is a postdoctoral research fellow in the non-linear physics lab
at [North Carolina State University](https://physics.sciences.ncsu.edu/) working
with Dr. [Karen Daniels](https://danielslab.physics.ncsu.edu/). She earned her Ph.D. from [McMaster University](http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/) under the supervision of Dr. [Kari Dalnoki-Veress](https://kdvlab.net/) in experimental soft matter physics.

Her area of expertise is [soft matter physics]({{ site.baseurl }}/research), an interdisciplinary branch of physics that studies any material that is soft, squishy and deformable.


Apart from her research, Carmen participates in various [science outreach]({{ site.baseurl }}/outreach) activities and she is a passionate advocate for improving Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in STEM.
